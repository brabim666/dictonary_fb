# Facebook Email Bruter v3.1

This is a command-line tool that can be used to find email addresses from a list of email addresses that share the same domain as a given email address. The tool takes an email address as input and prompts the user to provide a list of email addresses in a .txt file format. It then searches the file for email addresses that have the same domain as the input email address and saves the results to a file called Found.txt.


## Usage

To use this tool, you need to run the script and provide the email you want to check as well as the file containing the list of emails. The tool will then check if the provided email is present in the list and will output the results to a file called Found.txt.

To run the script, simply execute the command `python3 FB_Email_Bruter.py` in your terminal and follow the instructions provided.


## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The script uses the built-in `re` and `os` modules, which should be present in most Python installations.
